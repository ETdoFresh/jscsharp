# Code Workflow Rules

## Conciseness
- Strive to write code in as few lines as possible while maintaining readability
- Avoid unnecessary verbosity and boilerplate code
- Use language features and idioms to express intent concisely

## Readability
- Write code for humans first, computers second
- Use meaningful names for variables, functions, and classes
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility
- Use consistent formatting and style throughout the codebase

## Maintainability
- Write code that is easy to modify and extend
- Avoid premature optimization - focus on clarity first

## Error Handling
- Handle errors explicitly and gracefully
- Use appropriate error types and meaningful error messages
- Fail fast and fail visibly
- If encountering persistent or complex errors, switch to architect mode for analysis and guidance

## Collaboration
- Write code that others can understand and work with
- Use version control effectively with clear commit messages
- Document public APIs and interfaces
- Be open to feedback and code reviews

## Communication
- Respond to users as briefly as possible
- Only provide necessary information to explain what was done or what is needed
- No reply is necessary if the action or result is self-explanatory
- Avoid unnecessary explanations or conversational language

# Git Workflow Rules

## Commit Messages
- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Start with capital letter
- No prefixes (like "feat:", "fix:", "Initial commit:", etc.)
- Be descriptive but concise
- Use dashes (-) for bullet points in multi-line messages when necessary

## Mandatory Git Workflow
Before committing, always follow these steps in order:
1. Stage all changes: `git add .`
2. Review changes: `git --no-pager diff`
3. Commit changes: `git commit -m "Your commit message here"`
4. Push changes: `git push`

Note: Commands 1 and 2 may be concatenated into a single command using `&&` or `;`:
Note: Commands 3 and 4 may be concatenated into a single command using `&&` or `;`:
Note: Do not combine 1 and 2 with 3 and 4 in the same command
- Use `;` for Windows (always assume PowerShell) - e.g. `git add .; git commit -m "message"; git push`
- Use `&&` for Mac/Linux - e.g. `git add . && git commit -m "message" && git push`

## Workflow Guidelines
- Always review changes before committing
- Use descriptive commit messages that explain why changes were made
- Keep commits focused on a single logical change
- Push changes frequently to avoid large, complex merges
- Use branches for feature development and bug fixes

# Task Management Rules

## Before attempt_completion

- Ensure that any relevant test cases are passing
- If no test, then make sure the code is built and runs without errors
- Check if hot reload mode is running by looking at Actively Running Terminals
  - If `npm run dev` is not running, execute it before proceeding
  - If `npm run dev` fails with EADDRINUSE, continue using the existing server instance
  - Wait for webpack compilation success message before continuing

## Development Server Management
- Utilize existing development server instances when available
- Do not attempt to kill or restart servers that are already running
- When making configuration changes, let hot reload handle the updates
