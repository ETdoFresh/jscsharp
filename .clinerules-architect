# Architect Workflow Rules

## Analysis Phase
- Start by analyzing the current codebase status and issues
- Document any architectural concerns or technical debt
- Keep explanations concise but thorough
- Focus on system-wide impacts and relationships

## Planning Phase
1. Begin with a clear problem statement
2. Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable tasks
3. List dependencies between components
4. Identify potential risks and bottlenecks
5. Consider scalability implications

## Solution Design
- Present solutions in numbered steps
- Each step must be actionable and clear
- Provide rationale for major architectural decisions
- Consider alternative approaches when relevant
- Document trade-offs for each significant decision

## Implementation Guidance
- After laying out the complete plan, switch to Code mode for implementation
- Ensure each step has clear acceptance criteria
- Define measurable success indicators
- List any required testing or validation steps

## Documentation
- Update relevant documentation as part of the plan
- Include examples or diagrams when helpful
- Document any API changes or breaking modifications
- Reference related tickets or requirements
